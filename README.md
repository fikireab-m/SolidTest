# Flutter Hello There

This is a simple Flutter project that displays "Hello there" on the center of the screen. And when you tap anywhere on the screen, the background color changes.

## Getting Started

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Install Flutter on your machine.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory and run `flutter run` or `flutter run -d <deviceid>` to run it on specific device from list of devices.

## How it Works

The `my_app.dart` file contains the coded ligic for this project. It uses a `StatefulWidget` to manage the state of the background color. When you tap on the screen, it calls `setState` to update the background color with a random color.
